# Week of August 15th-19th

- **Something I am struggling with this week**  scheduling jobs, and active records with the rails framework. 

- **Something I learned this week**, due to the rails framework and scaffolding you can't just add ruby files, methods, or classes. This is due to the framework doing a lot of associations and other configurations unbeknownst to the user/dev.  

- **Something I have gotten better at this week**, troubleshooting random issues as I noticed it's taking me far less time to research and solve problems than before.  

- **Some specific strategies I use to get unstuck are**, documentation, I spent lots of time this week blocked by the active jobs framework in ruby on rails. I am still reading up on it and the gems I can use to solve the cron style jobs I need to run for the ETL process.
