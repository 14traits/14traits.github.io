# Week of August 1st - 5th

- **Something I am struggling with this week**  I have noticed I am becoming to overly familiar with methods, when doing white-boarding I am jumping to methods instead of doing them the long way around. 

- **Something I learned this week**, I am reading up on Docker and Docker compose so that I can containerize my build environments as well as production later. I also stumbled up on Swagger UI, I am going to us it with my backend api. 

- **Something I have gotten better at this week**, I feel that I have gotten a bit better at white-boarding. As a INTJ personality profile, I tend to compartmentalize thought inside my head until I feel i have something that adds value or solves the problem before sharing my thoughts with others. 

- **Some specific strategies I use to get unstuck are**, I use google and I learned a lot from reading various articles on Medium this week. Which isn't meant to be a plug for their platform, but hey if the content is there.. that is where I shall go.
