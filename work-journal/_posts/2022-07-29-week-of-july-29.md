# Week of July 25th - 29th

- **Something I am struggling with this week**  we started the capstone, and I am dreading the wire-frame part. I feel like it will be similar to researching on wikipedia and could be a huge time sink. 

- **Something I learned this week**, that I like Vue JS much more than raw JS. 

- **Something I have gotten better at this week** class / life balance, I am making it more of a point to focus on some things outside of the class. Setting some goals for outside things is helping immensely with the days blurring a bit to much together. 

- **Some specific strategies I use to get unstuck are**, I use google and I learned a lot from my our fellow classmates this week..
