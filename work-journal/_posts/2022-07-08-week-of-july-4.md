# Week of July 4th - 8th

- **Something I am struggling with this week** is params, and the use cases for how to use the different situations. The homework for it was literally the first time the homework was harder than the option deep dive (extra homework).

- **Something I learned this week**, was getting comfortable with the ruby on rails framework. Much practice, will hopefully make it more instinctive on what needs to be done and when.

- **Something I have gotten better at this week** is syntax for methods. The last several weeks it has felt cryptic and like I am trying to make sense of hieroglyphics. This week I a able to more or less figure out what it wants, but still need to research how to get it to spit out the data the way asked or makes sense.

- **Some specific strategies I use to get unstuck are**, this week I have pretty much just used google and StackOverflow to find the syntax questions I have had.

- **I was asked this week about "How do my interests, hobbies, and previous experiences relate to the things that you enjoy about coding in general".** To that I would say that they start the discovery process towards things I would like to work on, but they don't limit them. Every time in life I have discovered a new "Jam" or something cool was more or less me deviating from my usual path onto ground I had never covered before. _Life is the journey of things, not the ending or the beginning of them._

### Interesting things

- **Programming resources/communities I've found to be useful** is this a YouTube video from John Rooney on [Always Check for the Hidden API when Web Scraping](https://youtu.be/DqtlR0y0suo). Since web scraping seems like it will be fairly important for my planned capstone project, I am trying to get ahead on the work I need to do.
