# Week of August 22nd-26th

- **Something I am struggling with this week**  I missed an opportunity to get our team ahead being to focused on what our work scope was instead of the bigger picture of the overall project. 

- **Something I learned this week**, once again the importance of communication with other teams you are working with.  We lost a day of time we could work on our project due to the backend team not being finished yet.  We were able to get started a half a day earlier working on planned designs.   

- **Something I have gotten better at this week**, working with pull requests and git merges.  

- **Some specific strategies I use to get unstuck are**, COLLABORATION, pure and simple thanks to Amanda and Brandon for the help with finding the stupid typo in the active record associations.
