# Week of June 27th - July 2nd

- **Something I am struggling with this week** is OOP syntax and syntax for methods, I know this will come with practice but it's been frustating on finding good documentation on how to pull methods, and classes from nexted folders in a project. Another example was the sytax needed to do an ETL process on data using `.each_with_object`, I got it working but I am still not sure I understand how to come up with the syntax on my own. (Not even sure the course has really covered this yet).
- **Something I learned this week**, that in ruby if your missing a File.close, it doesn't show up with you do a diff from the terminal. It also doesn't show in a compare in VS Code. This can be maddening when your trying to make identical files.... my inner child was starting to look at the mad hatter like "that is a nice hat".
- **Something I have gotten better at this week** is accetpting that it's ok to look up "syntax" and not beat myself up internally for not being able to pull the sytax out of thin air on demand.
- **Some specific strategies I use to get unstuck are**, smart friends and google search but mostly _smart friends_!
