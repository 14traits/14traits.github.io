# Week of September 5th - 9th

- **Something I am struggling with this week**  Learning how to trouble shoot build issues in docker. Lots of reading and googling.  

- **Something I learned this week**, I taught myself GitHub Actions and Digital Ocean to be able to set up a CI/CD pipeline for my project that will auto deploy upon a pull request. 

- **Something I have gotten better at this week**, being ok with things that are not working and accepting that there will always be a new challenge even on a potentially stable project. 

- **Some specific strategies I use to get unstuck are**, collaboration and research it always better to know where to find help from friends and peers.
