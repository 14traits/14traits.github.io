description: >
  USMIRS 1.1 is a system of interconnected services that enables the Mission of USMEPCOM. The tech stack consists of Ruby, Ruby on Rails, React, and a Postgress DB. It lives in AWS GovCloud, and most of my contrbutions to the project were in the DevSecOps world creating a CI/CD process and edting IAC (Infrastrucre as Code). During it's final stages of deployement I lead a team of Civil Service engineers to deploy a Biometrics Solution that could not be done by our contract team. We successfuly deployed the USMEPCOM's first and only (so far) Gov lead/developed cloud deployment to AWS. I was also the only engineer on the team who could read/write terraform code, so I solely refactored and developed missing parts of IAC to accept entirely differnt Server OS platform.
